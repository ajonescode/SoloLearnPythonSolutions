"""""Remainder


We need to distribute textbooks to students.
There are 37 pupils in the class and each one should get 2 textbooks. The total number of books available for distribution is 76.

Task
Write a program to calculate and output how many books will be left after the distribution.

Hint
You just need to find the remainder from dividing 76 and total number of needed books (37*2), then print the result. """


#your code goes here

classOne = 18
classTwo = 19


result = (classOne + classTwo)*2

nextResult = 76 - result

print(nextResult)
